-Commitment2.m
	The main function. I takes parameters and compute the commitment equilibrium

-profiler.m
	Simple code to call commitment2.m and experiment

-V_vs(that-bailout).m
	Compute the commitment eq for different values of that and bailout
	Plots a contour and some slices

-flattax_vs_onlybailout.m
	Compares the commitment equilibrium for different values of that (with no bailout)
	with the equivalent bailout/zero tax schedule.
